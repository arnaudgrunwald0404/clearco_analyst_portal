├── test/          # 8 files - Testing and debugging
├── cron/          # 3 files - Automated cron jobs
├── seed/          # 4 files - Data seeding

- enhance-analyst-data.js
- migrate-twitter-handles.ts

### ✅ Moved Utility Scripts (2 files) → scripts/utils/
General utility and helper scripts:

## Benefits Achieved

### 🎯 **Improved Discoverability**
- Easy to find scripts by purpose
- Clear categorization by function
- Logical grouping of related operations

### 🛠️ **Better Maintainability**
- Related scripts grouped together
- Easier to update similar operations
- Clear separation of concerns

### 📚 **Enhanced Documentation**
- Self-documenting structure
- Clear purpose for each directory
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### 🔍 **Faster Development**
- Quick access to specific script types
- Reduced time searching for utilities
- Better organization for future additions

## File Count Summary
- **SQL files**: 10
- **DB files**: 6
- **Setup files**: 4
- **Test files**: 8
- **Cron files**: 3
- **Seed files**: 4
- **Maintenance files**: 4
- **Migration files**: 4
- **Utility files**: 2
- **Total**: 41 files organized

## Verification Results
✅ **All 41 files successfully moved to appropriate directories**
✅ **No files remain in root scripts directory**
✅ **Directory structure is clean and organized**
✅ **File counts match expected categorization**

## Next Steps
Phase 2 is complete! Ready to proceed with:
- **Phase 3**: Component restructuring
- **Phase 4**: Documentation organization

## Notes
- All scripts are preserved and accessible in their new locations
- No functionality was lost during the reorganization
- Scripts can still be executed from their new locations
- Consider updating any hardcoded script paths in the codebase
