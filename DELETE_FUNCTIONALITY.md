# Delete Analyst Functionality

## 🗑️ Overview

The delete analyst functionality implements a **soft delete** approach, archiving analysts rather than permanently removing them from the database. This preserves all historical data and relationships while hiding archived analysts from active lists.

## ✨ Features

### 1. **Soft Delete (Archive)**
- Sets analyst status to `ARCHIVED`
- Preserves all historical data and interactions
- Hides from active analyst lists
- Allows restoration later if needed

### 2. **User-Friendly Interface**
- Three-dots menu (⋯) in the Actions column
- Confirmation modal with clear explanation
- Loading states during operation
- Success/error feedback

### 3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Individual analyst deletion
- Bulk operations support
- API endpoints for all operations
- Proper error handling

## 🔧 Implementation

  }
}
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### **What Gets Archived**
- ✅ Analyst record (status → ARCHIVED)
- ✅ All historical interactions preserved
- ✅ All briefings preserved

- ✅ All covered topics preserved
- ✅ All newsletter subscriptions preserved

### **What Gets Hidden**
- ❌ From default analyst listings
- ❌ From active dropdowns/selectors
- ❌ From relationship health calculations
- ❌ From active analytics

### **Database Changes**
```sql
UPDATE analysts 
SET status = 'ARCHIVED', updated_at = NOW() 
WHERE id = 'analyst_id'
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### **Frontend Validation**
- Prevents double-clicks during processing
- Validates analyst exists before showing menu
- Handles network errors gracefully

### **Backend Validation**
- Checks analyst exists
- Prevents archiving already archived analysts
- Validates permissions (if implemented)
- Transaction safety

### **Error Messages**
- `404`: "Analyst not found"
- `400`: "Analyst is already archived"
- `500`: "Internal server error"

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Filter Settings**
```typescript
// Default filter excludes archived
const whereClause = includeArchived ? {} : {
  status: {
    not: 'ARCHIVED'
  }
}
```

### **Status Options**
- `ALL` → Shows only active/inactive (excludes archived)
- `ACTIVE` → Shows only active analysts
- `INACTIVE` → Shows only inactive analysts  
- `ARCHIVED` → Shows only archived analysts

## 🚀 Testing

### **Manual Testing Steps**

1. **Single Delete**:
   - Go to analysts page
   - Click three-dots menu on any analyst
   - Click "Archive Analyst"
   - Confirm in modal
   - Verify analyst disappears from list
   - Check status filter for "Archived" to see it

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Try to archive same analyst twice
   - Disconnect network during operation
   - Verify proper error messages

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Archive an analyst with interactions
   - Verify all data preserved in database
   - Verify relationships maintained

### **API Testing**
```bash
# Archive analyst
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3002/api/analysts/analyst_id \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Bulk archive
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3002/api/analysts/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"analystIds": ["id1", "id2"], "action": "archive"}'

# Bulk restore  
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3002/api/analysts/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"analystIds": ["id1", "id2"], "action": "restore"}'
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Audit Trail**: Log who archived what and when
2. **Bulk UI**: Add checkbox selection for bulk archive
3. **Restore UI**: Add restore button in archived view
4. **Auto-Archive**: Archive inactive analysts after X months
5. **Permanent Delete**: Admin-only hard delete after archive period
6. **Dependencies**: Show impact before archiving (interactions, briefings, etc.)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Authorization**: Ensure only authorized users can archive
- **Audit Logging**: Track all archive operations
- **Data Retention**: Comply with data retention policies
- **Cascade Rules**: Define behavior for dependent records

The delete functionality is now fully implemented and ready for testing!
