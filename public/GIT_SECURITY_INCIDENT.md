# Git Security Incident & Resolution

## Incident Summary
On July 2nd, 2025, sensitive information was accidentally committed to the repository in the `.env` file. This included:
- Database credentials
- API keys
- OAuth secrets
- Service tokens

The commit was detected by GitHub's secret scanning protection, which blocked the push due to exposed secrets.

## Initial Challenges

### 1. Failed Push Attempt
The initial push was blocked by GitHub with the following error:
```
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found for refs/heads/main
remote: - GITHUB PUSH PROTECTION
```

### 2. First Resolution Attempt
We initially tried to remove the `.env` file using `git rm --cached .env`, but this didn't work because:
- The file was already committed
- The sensitive information remained in the git history

### 3. Second Resolution Attempt
We then tried using `git filter-branch`:
```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```
This approach was discouraged by Git with a warning about potential issues.

## Final Solution

### 1. Using git-filter-repo
We ultimately used `git-filter-repo`, which is the recommended tool for repository history rewriting:

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo
brew install git-filter-repo

# Remove .env from all history
git filter-repo --force --invert-paths --path .env

# Reconnect to remote after filter-repo removes it
git remote add origin https://github.com/arnaudgrunwald0404/clearco_analyst_portal.git

# Force push cleaned history
git push origin --force --all
```

### 2. Post-Clean Up Steps
After cleaning the repository:
1. Verified the `.env` file was removed from history
2. Ensured `.env` was properly listed in `.gitignore`
3. Restored the `.env` file locally (but not committed)
4. Created `.env.example` with placeholder values for documentation

## Preventive Measures

### 1. Environment Files
- Never commit `.env` files
- Always use `.env.example` for documentation
- Add `.env*` to `.gitignore`

### 2. Git Hooks
Consider implementing pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of sensitive files:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q ".env$"; then
    echo "Attempting to commit .env file. Aborting."
    exit 1
fi
```

### 3. GitHub Security Features
- Enable and maintain GitHub's secret scanning feature
- Set up branch protection rules
- Configure required status checks

## Security Follow-up
After removing sensitive information from Git history:
1. Rotate all exposed credentials
2. Update all service tokens
3. Regenerate API keys
4. Update OAuth secrets
5. Acknowledge and close GitHub security alerts

## Reference Commands
Quick reference for similar incidents:
```bash
# Check if .env is in git history
git log --all --full-history -- .env

# Remove file from git history
git filter-repo --force --invert-paths --path .env

# If remote is removed, add it back
git remote add origin <repository-url>

# Force push cleaned history
git push origin --force --all
```

## Lessons Learned
1. Always use `.gitignore` from the start of a project
2. Create `.env.example` as part of project setup
3. Use GitHub's security features
4. Regular security audits of repository history
5. Document all security-related procedures
