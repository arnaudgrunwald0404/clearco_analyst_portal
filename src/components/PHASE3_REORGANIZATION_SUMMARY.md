- Easy to find components by type and purpose
- Clear categorization by function
- Logical grouping of related components

### 🛠️ **Better Maintainability**
- Related components grouped together
- Easier to update similar component types
- Clear separation of concerns

### 📚 **Enhanced Documentation**
- Self-documenting structure
- Clear purpose for each directory
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### 🔍 **Faster Development**
- Quick access to specific component types
- Reduced time searching for components
- Better organization for future additions

## File Count Summary
- **UI components**: 17 (existing)

✅ **File counts match expected categorization**

## Next Steps
Phase 3 is complete! Ready to proceed with:
- **Phase 4**: Documentation organization
- Update import paths in the codebase
- Create component README files

## Notes
- All components are preserved and accessible in their new locations
- No functionality was lost during the reorganization
- Components can still be imported from their new locations
- Consider updating import statements throughout the codebase
